                </dt>
                <dd>In 2018, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued a temporary order to address the opioid
                    crisis in the US. The order placed 17 fentanyl-related substances (fentanyl analogues) as Schedule I
                    drugs, meaning the drugs have no medical use and have a high potential for abuse. <strong>Schedule I
                        categorizations carry the most severe criminal penalties.</strong> The two-year order expires on
                    February 6,
                    2020 and cannot be extended without congressional action.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    S. 3201, which is being voted on under suspension today, will <strong>extend the DEA’s temporary
                        order for
                        an additional 15 months</strong> and authorize a GAO study on fentanyl drugs. While the DOJ and
                    law
                    enforcement claim the order allows them to prevent fentanyl-related overdoses, criminal justice
                    organizations, such as the ACLU, <strong>cite that 77% of individuals prosecuted for
                        fentanyl-related
                        substances were people of color, 39.1% of whom were Black.</strong> Of those, <strong>97.4% were
                        sentenced to prison,</strong>
                    and 44.6% carried a mandatory minimum penalty (some could seek relief). If S. 3201 passes, it will:
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Continue to allow for simple possession as grounds for prosecution (instead of a case-by
                            case determination)</li>
                        <li>
                            Extend mandatory minimum sentencing provisions
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Continue to tie mandatory minimum sentencing to the quantity of fentanyl in possession
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    If it does not pass, the order will expire next week. Fentanyl will remain illegal if S. 3201 does
                    not pass, and prosecutors will need to use the Federal Analogue Act to prosecute fentanyl-related
                    crimes on a case-by-case determination. Under the Federal Analogue Act, mandatory minimums can only
                    be invoked with death or serious bodily injury (not quantity or possession).

                <dd>The bill passed the Senate unanimously, but ran into issues yesterday at a Crime, Terrorism, and
                    Homeland Security subcommittee hearing:
                </dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Chairwoman Karen Bass said she is concerned that federal sentencing guidelines related to
                        fentanyl may mean many defendants who are not high-level traffickers may be unnecessarily
                        subjected to mandatory minimums that in fact become life sentences. She said that the DOJ can
                        still prosecute individuals under a related piece of legislation, the Federal Analogue Act.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Congresswoman Lucy McBath asked about the seemingly conflicting goals of public health and
                        criminal justice equity.

                    <li>
                        Congresswoman Lee believes that fentanyl should remain Schedule I, though voiced opposition to
                        mandatory minimum sentencing.

                    <li>
                        The Federal Public Defender in the Northern District of Alabama is in opposition, and said:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                “There are troubling signs that Congress’s response to fentanyl threatens to erase the
                                gains
                                of the past decade by returning to the failed and unjust strategies of the drug war.
                                Some
                                legislators who have supported the bipartisan movement away from the War on Drugs are
                                nevertheless endorsing a harsh and punitive response to fentanyl.”
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <dd>
                    Groups in favor of the bill generally call for the one-year extension in order to conduct studies,
                    produce a report, and prepare a more substantive response in the future. However, the ACLU and 46
                    other organizations opposed the bill in a recent coalition letter. Some conservative groups, such as
                    FreedomWorks, a libertarian group, also oppose the bill. The top five districts for fentanyl
                    trafficking offenders – located in Massachusetts, Ohio, California, and New Hampshire – have several
                    CBC members as well. However, the bill has support from all 50 attorneys general.
